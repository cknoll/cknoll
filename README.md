- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  -   so called explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
  -   Knowledge representation and applications of it
    -   (especially in the domains (partly overlapping) of *engineering* and *sustainability*)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: [Semantic-related Python projects](https://pysemtec.org/), interesting domain ontologies, and â€“ of course â€“ all of my (forked) repos.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: Understanding (and improving) some intricate details of ontology engineering and knowledge representation
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  - Python (I co-authored a book on [Python for engineering](https://python-fuer-ingenieure.de))
  - eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)
  - Knowledge Representation (RDF, OWL, SPARQL)
  - Control Theory
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: via [email](https://tu-dresden.de/ing/elektrotechnik/iee/ge/die-professur/beschaeftigte) (see also commit messages)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I believe there is a non-empty intersection of realistic and optimistic predictions of future developments.
